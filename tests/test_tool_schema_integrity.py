"""
Recurrence guard: every registered MCP tool's inputSchema must be accepted by
the Anthropic Messages API.

Context (2026-07-06): three tools (`inspect_spell_gem`,
`validate_support_combination`, `inspect_keystone`) shipped a top-level
`oneOf` in their `inputSchema`. The Anthropic Messages API rejects top-level
`oneOf`/`allOf`/`anyOf` with a 400 during `tools/list` validation — which fails
the ENTIRE conversation, not just the offending tool, for every Anthropic-backed
client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, SDK). External contributor Thiago Noronha
(@3lackd-projetos) reported it; the schema constraints were redundant because the
handlers already do alias OR-fallback and return a friendly error when none is
supplied.

These tests walk the tools the server ACTUALLY registers (not the source text)
and assert each schema stays inside the API's accepted shape, so the whole class
of bug can't silently return via a new tool.
